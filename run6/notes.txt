waterfilling instance #0  for 20 switches also matches up to end level 376 sth though in printing the mpmath version shows 16 digits and numpy shows 8 digits. how do I make sure that the mpmath is not using same precision as numpy? or maybe waterfilling rates are okay because it's R2 = (c2 - R1)/n2 .. only around 80 sums err is sqrt(80) times 10^-14 and R3 = (c3 - R2 - R1)/n2 =  (c3 - (c2 - R1)/n2 - R1)/n2
and R4 = (c4 - (c3 - (c2 - R1)/n2 - R1)/n2 - (c2 - R1)/n2 - R1)/n4. how many summations? 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + .. Rn = 2^n R1 err(Rn) = 2^n/2 R1 ~ 10^n/6 R1. n = 300 -> 10^50 Hmm so what I said isn't right. means I need precision of at least 50 digits..
