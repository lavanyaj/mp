Looks like this version doesn't converge
- Tried on a 10K link example, shouldn't take more than 10K rounds? But doesn't converge in 10K rounds either. [Possible that it needs 40K rounds]
- Checked condition that flow rates of levels >i should be at least big as last level that converged, not true in instance #98

Maybe one last try would be to try on 1K instances of
20 switch (400 links) and 100 flows per link (4000 flows)
400 links shouldn't take more than 1600 rounds?

num flows * 10 links/ flow = 100 flow/link * 400 links
